#### Loved by our clients for its ease of use

üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü **Easiest and best working plugin I have used so far**
When I wanted to find a paywall for my blog I really got frustrated with different plugins, managed to get them to work, but they were difficult to use and always something went wrong. I was recommended to use Zlick Paywall and as I am no IT-genius it was easy to install even for me, works perfectly and the support team is always willing to help and answers all questions professionally and very quickly. Would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a paywall.
